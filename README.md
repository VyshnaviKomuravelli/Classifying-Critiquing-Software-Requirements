This project focuses on classifying software requirements into three categories: Functional (F), Non-Functional Requirements (NFR), and User Experience (UX). Various models are explored, including BERT, SVM with Doc2Vec, FastText, BERT, LSTM, Logistic Regression, and Multinomial Naive Bayes. The project also implements oversampling techniques to address class imbalance. And generated the feedbacks for Software requirements.
